This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is not only to show that I can code from a UI perspective, but that I am also well-versed in logic and consuming APIs that are very important to everyday projects.

## Things you should know

This project was created with completeness in mind. It boasts Firebase Firestore (database) with "live" data, React's Context API, the Google Places API, as well as a front end architecture that it meant for a true web app. Please keep these points in mind as you play with the web page:

* Searching is fully functional.
  * It ignores the last dropdown.
  * There is no true radius search, but that selection is used for text in the results section.
* There is no pagination. Firebase Firestore is limited in its capabilities, so I skipped it to focus on other areas.
* There are a few UX changes made that I thought would benefit the users going to this page.
* Here are the cities you can use for search to get results:
  * Los Angeles
  * San Francisco
  * San Diego
  * Sacramento
  * San Jose
  * Fresno
  * Oakland
  * Long Beach
  * Bakersfield
  * Anaheim
  * Riverside
  * Irvine
  * Pasadena
